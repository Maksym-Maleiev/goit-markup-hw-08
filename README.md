# WebStudio

## General information

> This is the first individual project of the `full-stack` course from
> [`GoIT`](https://goit.global/ua/) company, layout section `(html/css)`.

- Create a repository `goit-markup-hw-08`.
- Design a responsive version of all pages and elements of the
  [`homework layout`](<https://www.figma.com/file/0uRxYENU9pFeOsq0U0u4IJ/Web-Studio-(Version-2.1)-(Copy)?node-id=1%3A3329&mode=dev>).
- Set up `GitHub Pages` and add a link to the live page in the header of the GitHub repository.

### Project

**`«A1»`** The `BEM` methodology is used.

**`«A2»`** It uses `SASS` preprocesses.

**`«A3»`** In the `index.html` and `portfolio.htm`l files, the minified style file `main.min.css`
from the `css` folder is included.

**`«A4»`** When viewing the page on any device with a width of `320px` or more, the horizontal
scrollbar does not appear.

**`«A5»`** The mobile menu script is included in HTML in a separate `mobile-menu.js` file.

### Markup

**`«B1»`** All pages in the `<head>` block have a `viewport` meta tag.

**`«B2»`** All background and content bitmaps are responsive and support `x1` and `x2` screen
densities.

**`«B3»`** Responsive background images use the `min-device-pixel-ratio` and `min-resolution` media
features.

**`«B4»`** Mobile menu markup completed.

### Decor

**`«C1»`** When writing styles, the `Mobile First` approach and the media function `(min-width: )`
were used.

**`«C2»`** Styles only needed in a certain range are closed in media queries `(min-width: )` and
`(max-width: )` or only `(max-width: )`.

**`«C3»`** There is no unnecessary duplication of styles in media queries.

**`«C4»`** The layout is made with respect to three breakpoints: 480px, 768px and 1200px.

**`«C5»`** Designed mobile menu.
